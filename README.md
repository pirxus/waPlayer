# waPlayer

aka Wiggly Air Player... is a simple music player written with Python 3 and PyQt5.


Dependencies: python3, pip3, PyQt5, eyeD3, tinyDB

To install necessary python dependencies, run the script dependencies.sh. Then you can run
the program either by launching the 'waPlayer' script or by going to the src folder and
executing 'python3 main.py'


# Library import
After launching the waPlayer, just hit ctrl+i to choose your music library folder.
The player can currently correctly import mp3 files only, however, you can use it
to play just about any standard music format.

If you encounter any problems, just exit the player and launch the dbPurge.sh script.
After that, just try to import the library again.

Happy listening!
