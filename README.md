#=======================LIBRARY IMPORT=========================#
After launching the waPlayer, just hit ctrl+i to choose your music library folder.
The player can currently correctly import mp3 files only, however, you can use it
to play just about any standard music format.

If you encounter any problems, just exit the player and launch the dbPurge.sh script.
After that, just try to import the library again.

Happy listening!
